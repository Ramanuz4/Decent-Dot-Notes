# Decent Dot Notes

## Vision

Decent Dot Notes aims to create a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for students to upload, share, and access handwritten notes. By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), this project ensures that notes are stored in a decentralized manner, minimizing reliance on central servers and maximizing availability.

## Features

- **Upload Notes:** Students can upload their notes by providing a unique topic ID, a subject title, and an IPFS hash where the note is stored.
- **Retrieve Notes:** Users can retrieve notes by entering the topic ID, which returns the note details including the subject title, IPFS hash, uploader’s address, and upload timestamp.

## Flowchart

Below is a simple flowchart of the Decent Dot Notes process:

1. **Upload Note:**
   - Student provides title, topic ID, and IPFS hash.
   - Contract verifies if the topic ID is unique.
   - Note is stored in the blockchain.
   - Upload event is emitted.

2. **Retrieve Note:**
   - User provides topic ID.
   - Contract checks if the topic ID exists.
   - Note details are retrieved and returned.

#### Contract Address

- **Network:**
- **Contract Address:** 0xfB36A7BA9A266e16c4c6EC312FD8739D221793c6
 
## Future Scope

1. **Access Control:** Implement role-based access control to restrict note uploads and access based on user roles.
2. **Advanced Search:** Develop a more sophisticated search mechanism to filter notes by multiple criteria.
3. **Monetization:** Introduce features for monetizing notes, such as paid access or premium note subscriptions.
4. **Integration:** Explore integrations with educational platforms and other decentralized applications (dApps) for enhanced functionality.
